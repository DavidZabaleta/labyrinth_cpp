#Labyrinth  C++

##Todo
- Add enemies to the map, their actions and routines
- Add difficulties to the game
- Add more levels to reach the victory
    - Ideal: make every level walls unique no matter how many times you run the game. 
        
        How? Make a random generator walls that can't exceed the limits.
